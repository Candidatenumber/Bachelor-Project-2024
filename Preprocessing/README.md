The purpose of this method was to preprocess the expression data and the clinical data to simplify and uniform the datasets, making them more manageable for further analyses. 
Further analyses was conducted using the preprocessed files, “expression_data_ccle_edited.csv”, “expression_data_tcga_log2.csv”, “clinical_ccle_data.csv”, and “clinical_tcga_data.csv”. 
The script “preprocessing_expression_data.R”  was used to preprocess expression files from the two databases, CCLE and TCGA. 
Expression file used for CCLE with name: “OmicsExpressionProteinCodingGenesTPMLogp1.csv” is available from https://depmap.org/portal/download/all/. 
Expression file used for TCGA with name: “EBPlusPlusAdjustPANCAN_IlluminaHiSeq_RNASeqV2.geneExp.tsv” is available from: https://xenabrowser.net/datapages/?cohort=TCGA%20Pan-Cancer%20(PANCAN)&removeHub=http%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A7222
