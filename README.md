# Bachelor-Project-2024

The repository was used in the analysis conducted during spring 2024 as a part of the bachelors program in Biomedicine at the University of Tromsø (UiT) – The Arctic University of Norway. The thesis was conducted with the Tumor Biology Research Group (TBRG). 
This study investigates the role of tripartite-motif proteins across various cancer types to identify their role as potential biomarkers. By analyzing data from two projects, the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Project (CCLE) and the Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA), the aim was to explore the expression of TRIM proteins in different cancer types and demonstrate why TRIM proteins can potentially be utilized as biomarkers for detection and diagnosis of cancer.
